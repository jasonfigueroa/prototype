place value
-----------    
    numbers 0 - 120:
        missing number in sequence (2d grid and ex. 1, 2, _, 4)
        number right before or right after x
    groups of 10
        number 20 has _ groups of ten
        7 tens = _
    10's & 1's
        7 tens + 5 ones = _
    2-digit place value challenge
        what num is the same as 3 tens + 10 ones
    equality
        x = y, true or false
    greater than, less than or equal
        single digits
        double digits
        true or false

add/subtract
------------
    add within 20
    add 3 numbers
    subtract within 20
    equal sign
        which is true
    find missing number (add and subtract within 20)
        c - _ = a
        _ - a = b
        c - a = _
    addition and subtraction word problems
        basic one liners
    word problems with "more" and "fewer"
        alan has 3 a's susie has 7 a's how many more does susie have
    add 1 or 10
        1 + 23 = _
        10 + 41 = _
        23 + 1 = _
        78 + 10= _
    add 1's or 10's (no regrouping)
        30 + 26 = _
        33 + 5 = _
        40 + 33 = _
    add 2-digit numbers (no regrouping)
        45 + 52 = _
        23 + 46 = _
        23 + 45 = _
    break apart 2-digit addition problems
        which can be used to find the value of 40 + 43
            answer: 4 tens + 4 tens + 3 ones
        which can be used to find the value of 12 + 84
            answer: 1 tens + 8 tens + 2 ones + 4 ones
    regroup when adding 1-digit numbers
        87 + 4 = _
        38 + 4 = _
        18 + 8 = _
        19 + 4 = _

mesurement & data
-----------------
    order by length (click and drag)
        tallest to shortest
    *indirect measurement (may not do this)
    measure lengths
        the item is _ squares long
    solve problems with bar graphs
        given graph with item a and b, how many more is a than b or vice versa
        given items a b and c what it the total among all three or just two of them
    tell time to hour or half hour
        whick clock displays x
        whick clock displays half past x
        fill in the blank based on clock image

geometry
--------
    name shapes
        circle, hexagon, trapezoid, triangle, rhombus, octogon
    halves and fourths
        which shape is divided in half
        which shape divided into quarters (or true/false)
            can also be described as fourths
        circle can be tricky
